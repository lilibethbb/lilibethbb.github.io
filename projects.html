        <h2>Network Traffic Analysis:</h2>
        <p>As part of my internship at TLC Firm, I was tasked with performing network traffic analysis to detect and mitigate potential security threats. Using tools like Wireshark and Snort, I analyzed network traffic to identify suspicious patterns or anomalies indicative of malicious activity. For instance, I successfully detected and mitigated a DDoS attack targeting our company's servers by analyzing traffic patterns and implementing appropriate countermeasures. These experiences honed my skills in interpreting network traffic and bolstered my ability to safeguard against cyber threats.</p>

        <h2>Caesar Cipher Decoder:</h2>
        <p>As a personal project, I developed a Caesar cipher decoder application in Python to automate the decryption of messages encrypted using the Caesar cipher algorithm. The application allows users to input an encrypted message and automatically decrypts it using all possible shift values, presenting the decoded messages for analysis. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in implementing encryption algorithms and understanding their weaknesses. Additionally, I expanded my proficiency in Python programming and cryptographic concepts.</p>

        <h2>Antivirus:</h2>
        <p>During my tenure at TLC Cybersecurity Company, I contributed to the development and testing of antivirus software aimed at protecting users from malware and other cyber threats. Working closely with the development team, I assisted in enhancing the malware detection capabilities of the antivirus software by analyzing malware samples, developing heuristic detection algorithms, and optimizing scanning algorithms for efficiency. Through rigorous testing and analysis, I helped ensure the effectiveness and reliability of the antivirus software in safeguarding against evolving cyber threats.</p>

        <h2>Build Your Own Encryption Software:</h2>
        <p>As a passion project, I designed and implemented my own encryption software using Java, which employed advanced encryption standard (AES) algorithms to secure sensitive data and communications. The software provided users with a user-friendly interface for encrypting and decrypting files using strong cryptographic algorithms, ensuring confidentiality and integrity of their information. By building this encryption software, I deepened my understanding of cryptographic principles and reinforced my programming skills while contributing to the cybersecurity community's efforts to promote data privacy and security.</p>

        <h2>Bug Bounties and Hackathons in Website:</h2>
        <p>I actively participate in bug bounty programs and hackathons focused on website security, where I collaborate with cybersecurity professionals to identify and report security vulnerabilities in web applications. Through these initiatives, I have discovered and reported numerous vulnerabilities, including SQL injection flaws, cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, and server misconfigurations, to organizations like Google, Facebook, and Shopify. My contributions have been recognized with bounty awards, invitations to private bug bounty programs, and invitations to speak at cybersecurity conferences. These experiences have sharpened my skills in ethical hacking and web application security assessment, allowing me to make meaningful contributions to improving cybersecurity posture across various industries.</p>
